Personal project that I used in learning some HTML, CSS, JS and a bit of Python.

It's a game that picks out two random capital cities, places them on a map and asks the user whether city A has a warmer or a colder temperature than city B.
The game then gets the weather temperatures of these two cities, and compares the user answer to the correct answer.

Still bit of a work-in-progress.

Inspired by the https://www.higherlowergame.com/.
